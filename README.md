My first day at the most reputed college in ludhiana that is GNDEC was very whelming and delightful.It started with all the RAI,ME,CE,EE,ECE students coming to the gurdwara sahib to take the blessing of the great lord.Then there was a shabad Kirtan.We all settled there approximately for an hour.The atmosphere was very calm.The raagis recited the kirtan in very melodious way. Then an ardass for our upcoming future was also done. Then there was a refreshment of tea and snacks.After we had registration outside the auditorium and we were also given a welcome kit.After that we all gathered and got settled in the auditorium.The first session was by Harsimran Sir who told us about the campus and most important what the GNDEC provides us. Then we had a adorable session with Harpreet Mam(HOD,Applied Sciences).Her lecture made us fell that we were already a part of GNDEC family
Our principal Dr.Sehijpal Singh then motivated us to make the best use of the opportunity.After the chief guest of the day Mahesinder Singh Grewal Sir the ex cabinet minister of Punjab and the member of nankana sahib education trust arrived. He said very wonderful words which touched my heart.At first he congratulated us for achievement to get admission in the most reputed college of ludhiana. He also shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds.He spoke from experience for about an hour in the continuity which was delighting.
